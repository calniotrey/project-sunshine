	# galactic market founded first time, detractors
    project_sunshine_article.1: "For the first time in history, the countries of the galaxy managed to overcome their differences and formed this galaxy first interstellar market! Located inside the borders of the §G[project_sunshine_article_1_market_founder.GetName]§! in the §Y[galactic_market_station.solar_system.GetName]§! system, it isn't shielded from heated debates.\nWhile some applaud what they call \"The first step towards galactic peace\", others have already started to protest against the market. A notable faction amongst the detractors claim the selection process for the host of the market has been nothing but a \"disguised auction encouraging bribery and corruption\". The host country benefiting from massive trade tax reductions seem to have been the main factor for this auction race. A new resolution for the relocation of the market has already been presented to the galactic community."
