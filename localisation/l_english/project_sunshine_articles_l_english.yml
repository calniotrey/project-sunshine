    # galactic market founded first time, detractors

    project_sunshine_article.1: "For the first time in history, the countries of the galaxy managed to overcome their differences and formed this galaxy first interstellar market! Located inside the borders of the §G[project_sunshine_article_1_market_founder.GetName]§! in the §Y[galactic_market_station.solar_system.GetName]§! system, it isn't shielded from heated debates.\nWhile some applaud what they call \"The first step towards galactic peace\", others have already started to protest against the market. A notable faction amongst the detractors claim the selection process for the host of the market has been nothing but a \"disguised auction encouraging bribery and corruption\". The host country benefiting from massive trade tax reductions seem to have been the main factor for this auction race. A new resolution for the relocation of the market has already been presented to the galactic community."
    # whenever, machines observing food habits

    project_sunshine_article.2: "It is well known that contrary to us machines, organic beings eat food. But little do people know that the organic countries force their population to eat a standardized food to simplify their logistics.\nIn a new study published in ... , fellow machines scientists ... and ... have exposed the conclusions they came after conducting a decade-long investigation. They observed the food being produced in farms through the whole galaxy and were surprised to find out that there are only 53 different types of food. From these 53, 19 are being produced from plants and 33 are produced from animals. The last one is obtained from the remains of dead members of the species consuming them.\nWhile this is considered a rare delicacy in these cannibal societies, it can be considered immoral or even taboo in others. To explain it to our fellow machines, we can compare this cannibalistic behavior to using parts of deceased machines when assembling a new one. But of course we don't have this vague organic concept of soul so it stays hard for us to grasp the moral issue.\nWe could of course think that there is only 53 different types of food existing in this galaxy. But the scientists discovered a pre FTL civilisation that has more than a hundred different types of food! Due to non-interference policies, the scientists weren't able to get an accurate number, but it still shows that primitive civilistions can achieve a far more diverse food production than galactic empires.\nIn the conclusion of their paper, they presented two hypotheses.standardization/eating a lot of pre sapients"

    project_sunshine_article.3: "Accident or biological warfare? The official explanation for the pandemic sweeping across the §YK cluster§! has been that it started from an unfortunate cross breeding incident on §YEarth§!; however, insider sources uncovered secret documents from within the Necrophage empire titled: §HThe Necrotic Plague§!. A mole was sent to study within their house of apotheosis to uncover their best kept secrets. The operation was risky, but the documents we've uncovered make it evidently clear that this pandemic was no accident. We asked for an interview with §MNecrophage Emperor Arthas§!, but we have yet to receive a response from him.\nThose who have been affected by the virus should seek medical attention immediately, and in the worst case scenario, quarantine themselves before passing. While the full details of the documents have yet to be deciphered, it seems that after the virus kills it's host, it somehow reanimates the body. Our chief scientists are perplexed by this phenomenal discovery, and are suggesting that all migration treaties between countries are ended immediately and that all citizens are put into quarantine. Take all precautions to avoid exposure to this \"§HNecrotic Plague§!\" and stay safe. We'll be covering further details as we continue to unravel the mystery behind these events.\n§T-Flying Scorpion§!"
