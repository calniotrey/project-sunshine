# Project Sunshine
This is a mod for the game Stellaris  
It adds an ingame newspaper called "Galactic Sunshine News"  
We welcome added content, proofreading and translations! You will be named in the credits.txt and on the steam workshop page.  
  
# Permissions
You are more than welcome to add content (either through pull request or by contacting me on the Stellaris Modding Den discord server in the #stellaris-list-extender channel).  
By contributing, you agree to have it used and published alongside this mod free of charge. You retain of course the intellectual property of your work, meaning it cannot be sold/used elsewhere without your approval. Your username will be added into the credits.txt.  
You are not allowed to publish this or variations of this on platforms that aren't github or gitlab without my approval (contact me if you want permissions, you will probably have it).  
Should you publish this or variations of this, you need to have a link pointing to this repository and you are not allowed to remove names from credits.txt (even if you remove the content added by these people).
